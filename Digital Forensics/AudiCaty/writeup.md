### DESCRIPTION
>The Spectrogram View of an audio track provides a visual indication of how the energy in different frequency bands changes over time. The Spectrogram can show sudden onset of a sound, so it can often be easier to see clicks and other glitches or to line up beats in this view rather than in one of the waveform views.

>When you got a message Flag{XXX}, please submit the flag with format CHH{XXX}

### SOLVED
Download the file and you get a squitgaem.wav audio file. Open it with Audacity and change the view to __Spectrogram__. The flag will appear immediately but the flag will be hard to see. So adjust your view a little bit and get the flag.
